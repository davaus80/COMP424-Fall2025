Helpers.py is a collection of functions that primarily make up the Ataxx game logic.
Beyond a few things in the World init, which can be copy/pasted this should be almost
all of what you'll need to simulate games in your search method.

Classes:
    MoveCoordinates         - a data class for storing (row, column) tuples for both the source and the destination of a move.

Functions:
    get_directions          - a simple helper to deal with the geometry of single tile moves ("duplications")
    get_two_tile_directions - a simple helper to deal with the geometry of double tile moves ("jumps")
    check_move_validity     - is this a valid move for a given player and chess_board
    count_disc_count_change - how many discs are gained by this moved (flipped or duplicates)
    execute_move            - update the chess_board by simulating a move
    check_endgame           - check for termination, who's won but also helpful to score non-terminated games
    get_valid_moves         - use this to get the children in your tree
    random_move             - basis of the random agent and can be used to simulate play

    For all, the chess_board is an np array of integers, size nxn and integer values indicating square occupancies.
    The current player is (1: Blue, 2: Brown), 0's in the board mean empty squares. 3's in the board mean obstacles.
    Move coords is MoveCoordinates instance containing two tuples - source and destination. Each tuple holds [row,col], zero indexed 
    such that valid entries are [0,board_size-1]
